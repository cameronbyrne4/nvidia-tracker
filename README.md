# nvidia-tracker
I want to see how people are investing in Nvidia! For a passion project in school.

This project will scrape subreddits related to investing, searching for post titles that are related to Nvidia (NVDA, NVIDIA), then displaying ones.

Here is what needs to be done:
1. dynamic frontend
2. Additionalyl read top reddit comments on the reddit posts
3. Add sentiment analysis that will compile the investment advice from reddit posts/comments, turning it into a single piece of investment advice

In the far future:
1. Allow user to search up different stocks
